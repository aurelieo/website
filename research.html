			<p> "When Punishment Doesn't Pay: 'Cold Glow' and Decisions to Punish", joint with <a href="http://alexpeys.github.io" target=_new> Alex Peysakhovich </a> <p> 
			<p> Forthcoming at the Journal of Law and Economics  <p>

<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: Economic theories of punishment focus on determining the levels that provide maximal social material payoffs. In other words, these theories treat punishment as a public good. Several parameters are key to calculating optimal levels of punishment: total social costs, total social benefits and the probability that offenders are apprehended. However, levels of punishment are often determined by aggregating individual decisions. Research in behavioral economics, psychology and neuroscience shows that individuals appear to treat punishment as a private good ("cold glow"). This means that individual choices may not respond "appropriately" to the social parameters above. We present a simple theory and show in a series of experiments that individually chosen punishment levels can be predictably too high or too low relative to those that maximize social material welfare. Our findings highlight the importance of the psychology of punishment for understanding social outcomes and for designing social institutions.</p>

			<p> "Incentives Structures and Criminal Justice"  <p>
			</div>
			
<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: How do incentive structures in the criminal justice, and in particular misalignments in costs and benefits of deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation options, affect law enforcement policies and practices? I examine these tradeoffs in US context, where decisions and costs of policing, sentencing and incarceration are most often reflected at different government levels (municipal, county, or state level). Depending on price-elasticity of judicial decisions and on fiscal externalities, the disjointed organization of law enforcement could affect local penal policies and crime levels. I test these mechanisms empirically using a natural experiment: the 1996 California Juvenile Justice Realignment, which shifted the cost of juvenile corrections from states to counties. Shifting the cost of incarceration from the state to counties led to a discontinuous drop in the number of juveniles being sent to state facilities, for youth with least severe offenses, for whom the price change was greatest. There is however no discontinuous change in juvenile arrests, generating a net social gains. These results highlight the importance of alignment of incentives across law enforcement agencies to reduce crime cost-effectively.</p>

			<p> Economics of Crime prize at the 6th Transatlantic Workshop on the Economics of Crime  <p>
			</div>
			
<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper investigates the effects of coverage of crime and criminal justice on sentencing outcomes, depending on the trial setting, and in particular presence of laypeople versus only experts. We look at the effect of television broadcasting of crime and criminal justice stories on sentencing decisions in criminal courts composed only of professional judges or including civilian jurors. We find that media content on the day before a trial affects sentencing with civilian jurors: sentences are longer after more coverage of crimes, and shorter after stories on judicial errors. However, we find no effect of media coverage on professional judges. This effect is driven by TV exposure to crime: crimes per se have no effect. Media seems to affect jurors? decisions very circumstantially, by making crime more salient, rather than by capturing deeper social currents or reflecting changes in levels of crime: the effects do not last over time. This paper contributes to the analysis of how context affects judicial decisions, and helps distinguish how different types of extraneous factors affect lay people versus experts: unlike for other psychological biases (priming, gambler?s fallacy, mental depletion?), experience can help mitigate the effects of domain-pertinent but irrelevant external information, as conveyed by media.</p>

<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: While theoretically important, the relationship between crime and employment is difficult to measure empirically. This paper addresses major identification challenges by exploiting high frequency data of daily online postings on job openings and closings at the county level, merged with individual-level administrative data about all inmates released from French prisons. We find that people who are released when jobs are being created are less likely to recidivate; conversely, people who are released when jobs are being cut are more likely to recidivate. We further show that news on job creation matters, over and beyond actual employment opportunities, suggesting implications for crime-control policies. From a methodological standpoint, this paper demonstrates how using media and online information on jobs can generate higher-frequency variation than administrative employment data, and help to overcome identification challenges to capture effects of variations in job market opportunities, especially when combined with other administrative sources..</p>

			<p> "Prison as a School of Crime: Evidence from Cell-Level Interaction"</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper investigates how interactions in prison influence post-release behavior, establishing at a fine granularity level how prison might act as a "school of crime". Using a unique French administrative dataset of all prisoners incarcerated since January, 2008, which includes cell allocation, we study interactions in own and cellmates' post-release behavior, and in particular in type of crime committed upon release, depending on self and cellmates? motive of incarceration. In French short-term prisons (which we focus on), cellmates typically spend a large portion of a day in their cells, and normal cell sizes are quite small (generally less than 6 inmates at a time), allowing us define extensively who one interacts with during the length of incarceration. By using number of days of overlap as a measure of intensity of interaction, we find evidence of peer effects for skill-intensive offenses, in case of recidivism.</p>

					<p> "Collective Sentence Reductions and Recidivism", joint with  <a href="http://www.jourdan.ens.fr/~emaurin/" target=_new>  Eric Maurin </a> </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper exploits the collective pardon granted to individuals incarcerated in French prisons on the 14th of July, 1996 (Bastille Day) to identify the effect of collective sentence reductions on recidivism. The collective pardon generated a significant discontinuity in the relationship between the number of weeks of sentence reduction granted to inmates and their prospective date of release. We show that the same discontinuity exists in the relationship between recidivism five years after release and prospective date of release. Collective sentence reductions increase recidivism and do not represent a cost-effective way to reduce incarceration rates or prisons' overcrowding.</p>
