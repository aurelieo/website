			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: How does the media affect behaviors of laypeople versus experts? We look at the effect of television broadcasting of crime and criminal justice stories on sentencing decisions, by juries of civilians and professional judges. We find that news on the day before a trial affects sentencing of juries of civilians: sentences are longer after more coverage of crimes, and shorter after stories on judicial errors. However, we find no effect of media coverage on professional judges? decisions. The effect on sentences is not due to actual crimes, but to exposure to crime on TV: crimes per se have no effect. Digging into mechanisms, it seems that media affects jurors? decisions very circumstantially, by making crime more salient, rather than by capturing deeper social currents or reflecting changes in levels of crime: the effects do not last over time. This paper contributes to the analysis of how context affects judicial choices; and distinguishes how different types of extraneous factors affect lay people versus experts.</p>

			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: Economic theories of punishment focus on determining the levels that provide maximal social material payoffs. In other words, these theories treat punishment as a public good. In calculating optimal levels several parameters are key: total social costs, total social ben- efits and the probability that offenders are apprehended. However, levels of punishment often are determined by aggregates of indi- vidual decisions. Research in behavioral economics, psychology and neuroscience shows that individuals appear to treat punishment as a private good (?cold glow?). This means that individual choices may not respond ?appropriately? to the parameters above. We present a simple theory and show in a series of experiments that individually chosen punishment levels can be predictably too high or too low relative to those that maximize social material welfare. We show how these individual choices can then lead to inefficiencies in final social outcomes, such as levels of punishment chosen and total costs incurred. Our findings highlight the importance of the psychology of punishment for understanding social outcomes and for designing social institutions.</p>

			<p> "Incentives Structures and Criminal Justice"  <p>
			</div>
			
<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: How do incentive structures in the criminal justice, and in particu- lar misalignments in costs and benefits of deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation options, affect law enforcement policies and practices? I examine these tradeoffs in US context, where decisions and costs of policing, sentencing and incarceration are most often reflected at differ- ent government levels (municipal, county, or state level). Depending on price-elasticity of judicial decisions and on fiscal externalities, the dis- jointed organization of law enforcement could affect local penal policies and crime levels. I test these mechanisms empirically using a natural experiment: the 1996 California Juvenile Justice Realignment, which shifted the cost of juvenile corrections from states to counties. Shifting the cost of incarceration from the state to counties led to a discon- tinuous drop in the number of juveniles being sent to state facilities, for youth with least severe offenses, for whom the price change was greatest. There is however no discontinuous change in juvenile arrests, generating a net social gains. These results highlight the importance of alignment of incentives across law enforcement agencies to reduce crime cost-effectively.</p>

			<p> "Prison as a School of Crime: Evidence from Cell-Level Interaction"</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper investigates how interactions in prison influence post-release behavior, establishing at a fine granularity level how prison might act as a "school of crime". Using a unique French administrative dataset of all prisoners incarcerated since January, 2008, which includes cell allocation, we study interactions in own and cellmates' post-release behavior, and in particular in type of crime committed upon release, depending on self and cellmates? motive of incarceration. In French short-term prisons (which we focus on), cellmates typically spend a large portion of a day in their cells, and normal cell sizes are quite small (generally less than 6 inmates at a time), allowing us define extensively who one interacts with during the length of incarceration. By using number of days of overlap as a measure of intensity of interaction, we find evidence of peer effects for skill-intensive offenses, in case of recidivism.</p>

					<p> "Collective Sentence Reductions and Recidivism", joint with  <a href="http://www.jourdan.ens.fr/~emaurin/" target=_new>  Eric Maurin </a> </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="container1">				
			<p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper exploits the collective pardon granted to individuals incarcerated in French prisons on the 14th of July, 1996 (Bastille Day) to identify the effect of collective sentence reductions on recidivism. The collective pardon generated a significant discontinuity in the relationship between the number of weeks of sentence reduction granted to inmates and their prospective date of release. We show that the same discontinuity exists in the relationship between recidivism five years after release and prospective date of release. Collective sentence reductions increase recidivism and do not represent a cost-effective way to reduce incarceration rates or prisons' overcrowding.</p>
